# Ransomware Simulation (Educational)

**Warning:** This repo contains code that simulates ransomware behavior. **Do NOT run** these scripts on real, production, or unauthorized systems. Use only for code review, learning, or in isolated lab environments with explicit permission.

## What’s included

* [ransomware.py](ransomware.py) — encryption + ransom-note simulation  
* [ransomwareClick.py](ransomwareClick.py) — trigger-based encryption demo  
* [decryption.py](decryption.py) — matching decryption utility  
* [Ransomware.pptx](Ransomware.pptx) — presentation  
* [Ransomware Simulation.mp4](Ransomware%20Simulation.mp4) — demo video  
* [Logic Bomb Ransomware.mp4](Logic%20Bomb%20Ransomware.mp4) — demo video


## Purpose

Simple educational project to show ransomware concepts and basic crypto usage (DES, AES, RSA). Intended for defensive training, incident-response practice, and classroom demonstration.
